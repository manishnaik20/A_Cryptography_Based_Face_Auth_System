# 🔐 A Cryptography-Based Face Authentication System for Secured Communication

This project combines **face recognition** and **cryptographic encryption** to build a secure communication system. It ensures that only authenticated users can access or send sensitive data, aligning with modern cybersecurity standards and AI-driven access control mechanisms.

---

## 💡 Key Features

- 🎭 **Face Authentication**: Real-time user verification using webcam and `face_recognition`.
- 🔐 **Data Encryption**: Secure your messages/files using symmetric encryption (Fernet – AES).
- 🔑 **Key Generation**: Automatically generates and saves a unique encryption key.
- 🔁 **Sender–Receiver Setup**: Simulates secure data transfer after successful authentication.
- 💻 **Compatible with Windows 11 + Python 3.13.2**

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.13.2  
- OpenCV (`cv2`)  
- `face_recognition` (dlib-based)  
- Cryptography (`Fernet`)  
- NumPy  
- Socket Programming (optional extension)

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. **Clone or download** the project files.
2. Set up your Python virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the sender (after adding authorized face images):
   ```bash
   python sender.py
   ```
4. On another terminal or system, run the receiver:
   ```bash
   python receiver.py
   ```
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to authenticate and transfer encrypted messages securely.

## 🔒 Security Note

- Make sure to **store the encryption key (`secret.key`) securely**.
- You can integrate this with cloud storage, APIs, or database access for enterprise-grade protection.

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- ✅ Add multi-face support  
- 🌐 Integrate with web frontend (Flask/Django)  
- 📱 Android/iOS face-auth extension  
- 📤 End-to-end encrypted file transfer
